# Image Building: Task Two

The security team love you ❤️. Deployments are great.

Unfortunately, the Ops team have now been in touch and they are
having trouble debugging in production. We've got the following
spec to be adhered to:

The image must:

1. Provide a `HEALTHCHECK` for automatic restarts

The image must be updated to include some debugging tooling:

1. `vim`
2. `ping`
3. `netstat`
4. `strace`
