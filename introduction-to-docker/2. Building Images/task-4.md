# Image Building: Task Four

ðŸ’¥ THINGS HAVE BLOWN UP AGAIN ðŸ’¥

Now the `NodeJS` and `Python` teams are starting to notice our
work. I say "our", because as the project manager, I get all the
praise ðŸ˜‚

Can we provide a stable / secure "base" image with our debugging
tools, and provide images on top of that for `python` and
`nodejs`?

Thanks, you're a ðŸŒŸ
