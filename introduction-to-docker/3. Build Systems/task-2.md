# CI: Task Two

## Build These Projects Using Multi-Stage

Take 2 OSS applications that you've relatively comfortable with and provide a multi-stage Dockerfile that facilitates local development and a production deployment.

Good examples for this are:
- Django
- Drupal
- exa
- Grav
- Laravel
- Rails
- Symfony
- Spina
- WordPress

Basically, any compiled CLI binary, web framework, or CMS
