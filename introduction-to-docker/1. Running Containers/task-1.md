# Docker Essentials: Task One

You have been given the *"HTML"* to a super-secret project. It
is your mission to provide a container that can be deployed to
production, serving the super-secret project.

```HTML
# super-secret-project.html
<p>Hello! This HTML was served by a container.</p>
```

**Hints:**

- Find some web-server image
- Expose the HTTP port to your host OS
- Mount in the HTML to be served
